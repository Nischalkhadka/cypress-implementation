# Introduction
## End-to-End (e2e) tests
In React, unit tests and functional tests are the most popular testing options as its easier to test components in isolation and as a functional units. Performing e2e tests, we can make assrtions about how the application renders and the way it responds during user's interacts with it.

## Why Cypress

https://www.cypress.io/

Cypress is a JavaScript end-to-end testing framework that makes it easy to setup, write, run and debug tests in the browser. It comes with its own dashboard that gives control over the status of our tests, and, because Cypress works in the actual browser, you can use the browserâ€™s dev tools side-by-side.


## Things to keep in mind
1) Frontend Testing Tool
2) Used by developers or QA engineers
3) Used to test the web application using Javascript framework
4) Mocha only as a Test runner
5) Fast as test code runs in the browser just like the application code.
6) Enables to write Unit, Integration and End-to-end tests
